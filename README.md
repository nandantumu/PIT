# PIT - Physics-Informed Toolbox

PIT (Physics-Informed Toolbox) is a project aimed at facilitating physics-informed or constrained learning for dynamics and control applications. The toolbox provides a set of tools and resources to assist researchers and practitioners in incorporating domain knowledge and physical laws into machine learning models.

## Features

- GPU accelerated Physics-informed learning algorithms
- Batched evaluation of dynamics
- PyTorch support

## Getting Started

To get started with PIT, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/nandantumu/PIT.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Explore the examples and documentation provided in the `bin` directory.
4. Customize and adapt the toolbox to your specific dynamics or control problem.
